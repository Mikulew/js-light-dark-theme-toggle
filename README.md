## General info

In people with normal vision (or corrected-to-normal vision), visual performance tends to be better with *light mode*, whereas some people with cataract and related disorders may perform better with *dark mode*.

*Definition:* **Contrast polarity** is a term used to describe the contrast between the text and the background:

**Positive contrast polarity** *(light mode)* refers to dark-font text on light background.
**Negative contrast polarity** *(dark mode)* denotes the combination of light (e.g., white) text on dark (e.g., black) background.

*Dark-mode* displays emit less light than light-mode ones (and, because of that, they might extend battery life). But the amount of light in the environment influences not only power consumption, but also our perception.

I made a small project that shows the possibility to switch from *light* to *dark mode* and vice versa. I learned a lot and found out that you can use the default settings in the operating system to display the preferred mode in the browser with `prefers-color-scheme`.

## Technologies

* HTML5
* CSS3 (prefers-color-scheme)
* JavaScript (ES6+, LocalStorage)
